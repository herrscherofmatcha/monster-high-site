            <p>The <strong>Haunt Couture</strong> line first released February 17 of <em>this year</em>. The first ghoul to serve lurks was Draculaura. Following suit was Frankie Stein and Clawdeen Wolf as these three girls are the primary protagonists of Monster High. Cleo de Nile was next with Lagoona Blue being the most recent to sell out.</p>
            <p>With Lagoona's successful and peaceful sale, many rumors tell that she is the last Haunt Couture doll in the line. The origin of these rumors comes from Lagoona's Haunt Couture page where it alluded to her being the last in the line.</p>
            <p>Mattel made it clear from the start that the Haunt Couture line would be the main 5 gals. Why exclude Deuce?</p>
